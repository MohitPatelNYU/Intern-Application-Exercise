Hello Respected Hiring Manager,

My name is Mohit Patel and I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science at New York University. I came to know about an opening of Software Developer Intern position at Hedgeye and want to represent myself for this position. I have that passion for technology and coding and I believe that I fit well in both team and independently. During my academic years and past internship experience I have exposure to Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many more programming languages. Apart from this I have done some cool and innovative projects which may excite you. 

One most important quality you will find in me is that I always seek feedbacks from my peers and mentors which makes me more strong and powerful in terms of my technology skills as well as workflow.

I believe that I will be a good fit for this role, though it may sound cliche, but I genuinely feel that.

Looking forward to hear from you.
